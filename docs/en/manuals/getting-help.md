# Getting help

If you run into a problem while using Defold we'd like to hear from you so that we can fix the issue and/or help you work around the problem! There are several ways to discuss and also report issues. Chose the option that works best for you:

## Report a problem on the forum

A good way to discuss and get help with a problem is to post a question on our [forum](https://www.defold.com/forum). Post either in the [Questions](https://forum.defold.com/c/questions) or [Bugs](https://forum.defold.com/c/bugs) category depending on the type of problem you have. When you post a support question make sure to include as much information as possible. Remember to [search](https://forum.defold.com/search) for your question/issue before asking as there may already be a solution to your problem. You must include the following for us to provide help:

* **Describe the bug (REQUIRED)** - A clear and concise description of the problem.

Selecting this menu option will bring you to an issue tracker on GitHub. Please fill out the form and include as much information as possible. Note that you need a GitHub account to submit a bug report this way.


## Discuss a problem on Slack

If you run into a problem while using Defold you can try to ask the question on [Slack](https://www.defold.com/slack/). We do however recommend that complex questions and in-depth discussions are posted on the forum. Also note that we do not accept bug reports submitted through Slack.
