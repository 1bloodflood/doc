#  Sprites

A Sprite component is a simple image or flipbook animation that is displayed on screen.

![sprite](images/graphics/sprite.png){srcset="images/graphics/sprite@2x.png 2x"}

The Sprite component can use either an [Atlas](/manuals/atlas) or a [Tile Source](/manuals/tilesource) for it's graphics.
